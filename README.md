# ECSE 424: Human Computer Interaction
### Fall 2019 - Taught By Prof. Cooperstock.

## Project Overview
Throughout the course, you will be involved in a group project: conceptualizing, designing, implementing, testing, and refining a system that will evolve from a paper description, to a simple prototype, and finally to a functional system.

The purpose of the project is to gain experience in applying concepts and techniques from the class to a real-world problem. What is most important to keep in mind is that your project marks are not determined by a wealth of functionality, nor by the complexity of what you tackle. Remember: this is a course on human-computer interaction.

The project theme this year is "tackling problematic Internet use"; more specifically, we want you to look for ways in which human-computer interaction design can help people live healthier lives in which they are not controlled by the pressures of Internet-connected device access. Because you will be working with human subjects during the semester, you will need to sign and submit an agreement to ethical research conduct before you can begin your activities. You must also complete a consent form for each participant with whom you work, and provide the participant with a copy of the form.

Note that whatever you choose to develop may already exist in some other form, in which case, one of your initial tasks in the first project deliverable will be to critique the existing version and identify what you consider to be its significant shortcomings that warrant you "re-inventing the wheel". Alternatively, your project idea may be inspired by a concept description, but not available in a functional implementation, or it may be something completely of your own invention. In any event, what we will be focusing on in our evaluation of your work is not the application itself, but rather, your ability to design, develop, evaluate, and refine an effective interface that supports a compelling level of interaction.
You are free to incorporate hardware components or re-use existing software, with proper acknowledgment.

## This Repo
This repo contains the code for the website we developped during this course that documents our design process. The design process consisted of the following steps and everything is documented in this repo:
* Project Pitch
* Project Notebooks
* Submission and Evaluation process
* Observations and Proposal
* Low-Fidelity Prototype and Test Plan
* Computer Prototype
* Formative Feedback
* Alpha System
* Beta System

You can find the code for the app created in the following repository :
