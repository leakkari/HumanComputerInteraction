    <h2>Design evolution</h2>
    <p>Based on the user feedback we received from testing our low fidelity prototypes, we decided to go with the ring application and combine some of the features from the other prototype that the users liked.</p>  <p>First we decided to add another option to how users can limit their usage. While testing some users complained about not having an option to limit usage by category and some have wished that the ring app had it. So we chose to have it as a choice and go even further by showing users the apps in each category and allow them to remove any of the apps in a specific in a category if they do not want it.</p>

So we chose to have it as a choice and go even further by showing users the apps in each category and allow them to remove any of the apps in a specific in a category if they do not want it.</p>    <p>We additionally did some minor changes based on feedback like giving filtering options for the usage activity graph, add a search bar to allow for a quicker selection of apps the user wants to limit and a suggested time limit based on average usage for users who are not sure how much time to choose.</p>
    <p>Because this app will ask for the user’s permission to get the necessary data, some testers were worried about what data was being used and how it is being handled. A setup page was dedicated to this in our second prototype but had user agreement that was too long to read. We decided to reduce the agreement, showing the most relevant data and explaining how the data is going to be used by the app. This will reassure users and this way we can be upfront about how our app works.</p>
    <p>Grouping rewards and the list of all friends was too cluttered and users had trouble finding their rewards from previous challenges. We decided to implement a separate page for rewards where users can go and fully appreciate their effort. This means that the friends tab is less cluttered now and just shows everything related to them.</p>
    <p>In the “ring” app prototype, we offered users the possibility to view a more detailed view of their usage through a graph by tapping the ring. Many testers were not even aware that the ring was clickable and that more data can be shown. Moving the graph below the ring makes it easier for users to notice and places everything on a single page.</p>
    <p>We additionally did some minor changes based on feedback like giving filtering options for the usage activity graph, add a suggested time limit based on average usage for users who are not sure how much time to choose. In the future we also plan to implement a search bar to allow for a quicker selection of apps the user wants to limit as some users can have a lot of apps installed on their phone.</p>

    <h2>Prototype Implementation</h2>
    <p>Please find our high fidelity prototype attached below and follow the user manual for setup.</p>

    <h2>User population</h2>
    <p>For our project proposal, we came up with three different personas according to the following three criterias: Social comfort,  time awareness and compulsion. When looking for users to test, select users who are in the age range of 19 to 24 (preferably university students). The first section of these users should start from people who are socially comfortable and active to people that are less comfortable and prefer to avoid social activities. The second section should include people who play a lot of games (video games preferably), people who are compulsive to users that do not often play games and have more self control. Finally the last section should have people that are tech savvy and people who are not really familiar with technology.</p>

    <h2>Usability goals</h2>
    <p><b>Ease of learning</b></p>
    <p>Measures how easily and quickly a user can learn the functionality of the app. Can be measured by observing the user’s ability to achieve a certain task within a determined amount of time (less than 20 seconds for each task). Ask the user to describe the main functionalities of the app after the user tasks are completed.</p>
    <p><b>Efficiency and Effectiveness</b></p>
    <p>Describes how a user interacts with the app once it is learned. Can be measured by observing the user’s ability to achieve a certain task within a determined amount of time, without encountering major obstacles or system errors. Count the number of taps it took the users to complete a task compared to the minimum number needed.</p>
    <p><b>Error tolerance</b></p>
    <p>While executing the user tasks take notes when the user makes a mistake and wants to redo or change a setting in the app. Take notes if the application allows users to input any data that is wrong without letting them know of the error before submitting their data.</p>

    <h2>Usability test procedure</h2>
    <p><b>How many examiners are required?</b></p>
    <p>The test requires two examiners, one person for observing, taking notes and making sure to record the test session. The second person should oversee, lead the test procedure and help the tester in case he has any questions.</p>
    <p><b>What equipment will the examiners need?</b></p>
    <p>Examiners will need an android phone with the latest OS plugged to the computer using a USB cable to transfer the APK file to the phone.</p>
    <p><b>How should your prototype be handled? (manual/documentation)</b></p>
    <p>Setting up the application will be provided in the user manual. As for all the information that will be needed during the actual testing will be provided in pdf form and should be printed and handed to one of the examiners.</p>
    <p><b>How will you instruct your examiners to proceed?</b></p>
    <p>Examiners should make sure the application runs fine and go through the user manual so they have a good understanding of how the app works. Test materials should be also printed and prepared before the actual testing starts.</p>
    <p><b>How should the examiners treat the test subjects, what should they tell them?</b></p>
    <p>To start, the examiners should read the observer briefing where we provided the main guidelines to follow during the testing process. Before giving the user the task he has to do, examiners should read the user introduction to make sure everything is clear and have the user fill out the pretest questionnaire.</p>
    <p><b>What should the examiners avoid doing?</b></p>
    <p>During and before the sessions, don’t engage participants in conversation, offer advice, correct them, or answer their questions, because introducing new information or giving unintentional clues can bias the research results and even invalidate that session’s data.</p>

    <p><b>What/How/When should the examiners measure?</b></p>
    <p>After the pretest questionnaire has been filled, the user introduction read to the user and the consent form signed, hand in the application to the user and start going through the following user tasks:</p>

    <h2>Reporting</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before examiners should print all provided testing materials before the test sessions. The video recording can be done with a phone and record the test results using the data collection sheet. Usability evaluation can be done on a computer or a piece of paper where every criteria should be evaluated. Note taking during the test session can also be done either on a computer or a piece of paper. All other test materials for reporting have been provided and should be printed and filled out correctly.</p>

    <h2>Usability Evaluation</h2>
    <p>In addition to the test script and the test tasks provided, we would like to do a heuristic evaluation of the prototype based on heuristics from Nielsen’s list.</p>
    <p><b>Heuristics:</b></p>
    <p><b>1. Visibility of System Status:</b></p>
    <p>The user should know what’s going on inside the system. When opening the app, the user should be able to see his progress towards limiting his usage through the ring, the provided history page and the activity graph. He should also be able to see how his friends are doing towards their goal throughout the day.</p>
    <p><b>2. Match between system and the real world:</b></p>
    <p>The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than systemo-riented terms. The application should motivate users to keep following their goals and to improve their phone usage, adding motivational prompts throughout the app and using a vocabulary closer to how we speak to each other provides a more personal experience.</p>
    <p><b>3. User control and freedom:</b></p>
    <p>This principle talks about giving the user the freedom to navigate, perform actions and to undo any accidental actions. If the user wants to change his usage limits after the initial setup, he should be able to modify them. The app should also check if the user removed a friend by mistake and allow the user to cancel that action.</p>
    <p><b>4. Consistency and standards:</b></p>
    <p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. A “Next” button in one page should look the same across the site on any page.</p>
    <p><b>5. Error prevention:</b></p>
    <p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. If you have set some rules for the format of user password when signing up, it should be validated on the go rather than waiting for the user to click submit.</p>
    <p><b>6. Recognition rather than recall:</b></p>
    <p>It’s always better to suggest the user a set of options than to let him remember and type the whole thing. The goal is to minimize the application of user memory.</p>
    <p><b>7. Aesthetic and minimalist design:</b></p>
    <p>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</p>
